This is a simple memory game built using React Native with TypeScript. The game displays a grid of cards with hidden symbols, and the player needs to find matching pairs by flipping two cards at a time. It includes features such as difficulty levels, a move counter, a timer, and a leaderboard.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siranshahi2014/learnovaTask.git

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   cd learnovaTask

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   yarn install

4. **Start the development server: For iOS**:
   yarn ios

## Assumptions and Decisions

Leaderboard: The leaderboard is local and uses redux-persist to store data on the device. This was chosen to avoid the need for a backend service, though a future implementation could involve a remote API for global leaderboards.

Difficulty Levels: The game has three difficulty levelsâ€”Easy (4x4), Medium (6x6), and Hard (8x8). The number of cards in the grid is adjusted based on the difficulty level chosen by the user.

Animations: Card flipping is handled using Animated from react-native. The flip animation time is set to 300ms for a smooth experience.

State Management: The entire game state is managed using Redux Toolkit. RTK Query is used to fetch symbols from a mock API.

## Completed Features

Card Flip Animation: Smooth card flipping animation when a card is clicked.
Redux Toolkit for State Management: The game state, including the cards, moves, and timer, is managed using Redux.
RTK Query Integration: Symbols for the cards are fetched from a mock API using RTK Query.
Leaderboard: Scores are stored locally using Redux Persist.
Move Counter: The number of moves made by the player is displayed.
Timer: A timer that tracks the duration of the game.
Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels with 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 grids, respectively.
Game Over Detection: The game detects when all cards have been matched and shows a game over message.
Persistent Game State: The game state is persisted across app reloads using redux-persist.

## Ideas for Future Improvements

Global Leaderboard: Integrate a remote backend API to store and retrieve high scores globally, allowing users to compare their scores with others worldwide.

Customizable Player Names: Add a feature where players can input their name before starting the game to be displayed on the leaderboard.

Sound Effects and Visual Feedback: Add sound effects for card flips, successful matches, and game completion, as well as haptic feedback on supported devices.

Multiplayer Mode: Add a multiplayer mode where two players can compete in real-time or asynchronously.

Theming Support: Add light and dark theme support for improved accessibility and user experience.
